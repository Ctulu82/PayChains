# PayChains SDK

Use the PayChains SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [PayChains Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/paychains-program) instead.

More information about PayChains is available in the [PayChains documentation](https://docs.paychains.com/).

The [PayChains Program Library](https://github.com/paychains-labs/paychains-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
